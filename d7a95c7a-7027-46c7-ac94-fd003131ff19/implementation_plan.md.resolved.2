# Foundation Substrate Embedding Plan

## Goal Description
"Embed" the ADK Integrity Gate into the **Foundation Model** (interpreted here as the **Base Docker Image** or "Substrate"). This involves creating a `Dockerfile` that compiles the ADK from source into a native Linux binary, making the integrity checks an intrinsic part of the environment.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> This plan assumes "Foundation Model" refers to the infrastructure base image (Docker).
> The Dockerfile will perform a multi-stage build to compile the ADK for Linux, independent of the local Windows `adk.exe`.

## Proposed Changes

### Infrastructure
#### [NEW] [Dockerfile.foundation](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/brain/d7a95c7a-7027-46c7-ac94-fd003131ff19/Dockerfile.foundation)
*   **Stage 1: Forge (Builder)**
    *   Base: `python:3.13-slim`
    *   Action: Install `pyinstaller`, copy `adk` source, build `dist/adk` (Linux binary).
*   **Stage 2: Foundation (Runtime)**
    *   Base: `python:3.13-slim` (or a lighter distro if Python isn't needed for runtime, but `adk` is Python-based so it's safer).
    *   Action: Copy `adk` binary to `/usr/local/bin/adk`.
    *   Action: Set `ENTRYPOINT` or default command to show `adk` presence.

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
*   Review the `Dockerfile.foundation` content.
*   (Optional) If Docker is available locally, build the image: `docker build -f Dockerfile.foundation -t adk-foundation .`
