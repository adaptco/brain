# Mega Man Game Engine Walkthrough

I have scaffolded the Mega Man Game Engine using the ADK framework.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Engine Core
- **[Orchestrator](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Orchestrator.hpp)**: Manages the game loop and sandbox.
- **[Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Sandbox.hpp)**: Container for the entities and world model.
- **[WorldModel](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/WorldModel.hpp)**: Generates procedural/mocked levels (currently implements rudimentary platforms and boss room logic).
- **[Physics](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Physics.hpp)**: Handles gravity, collision detection, and enforcement of safety bounds.

### 2. Agents
- **[Avatar](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Avatar.hpp)**: Implements Mega Man's state machine (Idle, Run, Jump, Shoot).
- **[Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp)**: A basic Boss agent that tracks the player.

### 3. Build System
- **[Makefile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/Makefile)**: Provided for compilation.

### 4. WebSocket Shell
- **[server.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/server.js)**: A Node.js server that wraps the C++ engine.
    - Connects via WebSocket (ws://localhost:8080).
    - Spawns the engine process.
    - Relays commands to `stdin` and state from `stdout`.

## How to Run

> [!WARNING]
> A C++ compiler (`g++` or similar) and `make` were not found in the current environment. You will need to install MinGW or use Visual Studio's developer command prompt to compile.

### 1. Compile Engine
```sh
g++ -I./include -std=c++17 src/main.cpp src/engine/*.cpp src/agents/*.cpp src/safety/*.cpp -o bin/ghost-void_engine.exe
```

### 2. Run WebSocket Shell
```sh
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```
Then connect a WebSocket client to `ws://localhost:8080`. Sending any message will trigger a frame tick.

## Verification
I have included a verification test file [tests/engine_test.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/tests/engine_test.cpp) which asserts that the Level Loading and Orchestrator initialization work correctly.
