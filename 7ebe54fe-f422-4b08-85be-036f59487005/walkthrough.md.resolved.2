# Mega Man Game Engine Walkthrough

I have scaffolded the Mega Man Game Engine using the ADK framework.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Engine Core
- **[Orchestrator](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Orchestrator.hpp)**: Manages the game loop and sandbox.
- **[Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Sandbox.hpp)**: Container for the entities and world model.
- **[WorldModel](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/WorldModel.hpp)**: Generates procedural/mocked levels (currently implements rudimentary platforms and boss room logic).
- **[Physics](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Physics.hpp)**: Handles gravity, collision detection, and enforcement of safety bounds.

### 2. Agents
- **[Avatar](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Avatar.hpp)**: Implements Mega Man's state machine (Idle, Run, Jump, Shoot).
- **[Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp)**: A basic Boss agent that tracks the player.

### 3. Build System
- **[Makefile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/Makefile)**: Provided for compilation.

### 4. WebSocket Shell & SPA Checkpoint
- **[server.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/server.js)**: A Node.js + Express server.
    - Serves the SPA Checkpoint at `http://localhost:8080`.
    - Manages WebSocket connections for the engine.
- **[client.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/public/client.js)**: The HTML5 game client.

## How to Run

> [!WARNING]
> A C++ compiler (`g++` or similar) and `make` were not found in the current environment. You will need to install MinGW or use Visual Studio's developer command prompt to compile.

### 1. Compile Engine
```sh
g++ -I./include -std=c++17 src/main.cpp src/engine/*.cpp src/agents/*.cpp src/safety/*.cpp -o bin/ghost-void_engine.exe
```

### 2. Run Shell & Client
```sh
cd server
npm install
node server.js
```
- Open a browser to `http://localhost:8080`.
- The connection status should turn green (if server is running).
- The Engine process will spawn when you connect (logic in server.js).

## Verification
I have included a verification test file [tests/engine_test.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/tests/engine_test.cpp) which asserts that the Level Loading and Orchestrator initialization work correctly.
