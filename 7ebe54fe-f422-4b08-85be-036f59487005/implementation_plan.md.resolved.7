# Mega Man Emulation Implementation Plan

Goal: Use the ADK framework to build a game engine scaffolding a Mega Man emulation, including level generation ("World Model"), avatar control, and physics.

## User Review Required
>
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The emulation will be text/state-based for the "Orchestrator" view. 9 Levels will be scaffolded via the `LevelGenerator`, but only the logic for platforming and boss encounters will be implemented, not the full graphical assets.

## Proposed Changes

### Build System

#### [NEW] [Makefile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/Makefile)

- Compiles `src` and `tests`.

### ADK Framework Setup (Prerequisites)

#### [NEW] [devcontainer.ide_control_surface.v1](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/adk/env/devcontainer.ide_control_surface.v1)

#### [NEW] [ide.compliance_checklist.v1](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/adk/policy/ide.compliance_checklist.v1)

#### [NEW] [ci_parity.v1](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/adk/runbook/ci_parity.v1)

### Engine Core (`src/engine`)

#### [NEW] [Orchestrator.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Orchestrator.hpp) / [main.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/main.cpp)

- **Game Loop**: Inputs -> Physics -> World Update -> Render (State).
- **Asset Loader**: Mock loader for "9 Levels".

#### [NEW] [Sandbox.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Sandbox.hpp)

- Holds the `WorldModel` and `Entities`.
- Manages strict framing (Side-scrolling window).

#### [NEW] [WorldModel.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/WorldModel.hpp) (Agentic Field)

- **LevelGenerator**: Procedurally generates platforms/hazards based on "Level ID" (1-9).
- **BossRoom**: Special segment at the end of a level.
- **Checkpoint**: State serialization point.

#### [NEW] [Physics.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Physics.hpp)

- **SafetyLayer Integration**: Enforces "World Boundaries" and "Collision" as safety constraints.
- Gravity, Jump dynamics, Dash.

### Agents

#### [NEW] [Avatar.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Avatar.hpp)

- "Mega Man" state machine (Idle, Run, Jump, Shoot).

#### [NEW] [Boss.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.hpp)

- Simple behavior tree for Boss (e.g., Jump, Shoot, Pattern).

### WebSocket Shell

#### [NEW] [server.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/server.js)

- Node.js WebSocket Server (`ws` library).
- Spawns the Game Engine process.
- Relays JSON messages between WebSocket and Game Engine Stdin/Stdout.

#### [MODIFY] [Orchestrator.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Orchestrator.cpp)

- Update game loop to read commands from Stdin.
- Output game state as JSON to Stdout.

### SPA Checkpoint (Client)

#### [NEW] [index.html](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/public/index.html)

- Main entry point. Defines the Canvas and UI controls.

#### [NEW] [style.css](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/public/style.css)

- Retro "NES" style CSS.

#### [NEW] [client.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/public/client.js)

- Connects to WebSocket.
- Sends inputs (Arrow keys, Space).
- Renders received state (Avatar pos, Level tiles) on Canvas.

### React SPA Migration

#### [NEW] [server/react-client](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/react-client)

- Vite + React + TypeScript (optional, sticking to JS for speed/consistency with previous files unless inferred otherwise, staying JS based on `server.js`).
- **Components**:
  - `App.jsx`: Main container.
  - `GameCanvas.jsx`: Handles Canvas Ref and Rendering loop.
  - `HUD.jsx`: Displays Score and Energy.
  - `ConnectionStatus.jsx`: Shows WS status.
- **Hooks**:
  - `useGameSocket`: Manages WS connection and state updates.

### Runtime Grounding (Stripe)

#### [NEW] [server/grounding.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/grounding.js)

- Middleware that listens for Stripe Webhooks.
- Translates `payment_intent.succeeded` into a `{"type": "genesis_plane", "origin": [0,0]}` command for the Engine.
- **Concept**: The financial transaction "grounds" the agent, creating a solid plane (platform) for it to stand on.

#### [MODIFY] [server/server.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/server.js)

- mount `grounding.js` at `/webhook`.

#### [MODIFY] [src/engine/WorldModel.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/WorldModel.cpp)

- Handle `genesis_plane`: Dynamically spawn a platform at the "Origin".

#### [NEW] [docs/grounding_exercise.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/docs/grounding_exercise.md)

- Instructions on using `stripe trigger` to generate the plane.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests

- `make test_emulation`:
  - Load Level 1.
  - Spawn Avatar.
  - Simulate 100 frames of running/jumping.
  - Verify Avatar reaches "Checkpoint" or interacts with "Boss".

# Sovereign RAG Pipeline: Batch Processing Evolution

Goal: Integrate high-velocity mechanical enforcement with long-term **Semantic Memory** by implementing an asynchronous batch embedding pipeline.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This upgrade assumes the existence of the `docling-pipeline` directory and its services. The "Sovereign" labeling requires strict adherence to SHA-256 identity and canonical hashing for document provenance.

## Proposed Changes

### Embed Worker (`docling-pipeline/services/embed_worker`)

#### [MODIFY] [tasks.py](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/docling-pipeline/services/embed_worker/tasks.py)
- Consolidate logic from `worker.py`.
- **`get_embeddings`**: 
  - Switch to local device detection (`cuda`, `mps`, `cpu`).
  - Implement `DataLoader` with `pin_memory=True` and `num_workers > 0` for high-throughput batching.
  - Implement a real embedding pass (if model is available) or a robust vectorized mock that maintains semantic fidelity.
- **`embed_batch`**:
  - Implement bulk upsert to Qdrant using the truncated SHA-256 (32 hex) ID protocol.
  - Ensure `source_block_refs` and model metadata are correctly mapped for audit trails.

#### [DELETE] [worker.py](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/docling-pipeline/services/embed_worker/worker.py)
 - Consolidate logic into `tasks.py` and use a generic RQ worker entry point if possible, or keep `worker.py` as a slim wrapper.

### Documentation

#### [NEW] [rag_pipeline.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/docs/rag_pipeline.md)
 - Technical guide on the **Semantic Ledger**, **Identity Protocol**, and **Integrity Protocol**.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `pytest docling-pipeline/tests/test_embed_batch.py`:
  - Verify SHA-256 ID unicity.
  - Verify L2 normalization output.
  - Benchmark batch vs single-chunk throughput.

### Manual Verification
- Use `stripe trigger` (conceptually) or a test script to ingest a large document and observe the `embed-worker` logs for batch processing performance.
