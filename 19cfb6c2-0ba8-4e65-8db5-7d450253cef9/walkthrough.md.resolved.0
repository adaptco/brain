# Walkthrough - IDE Control Surface Pack

I have successfully implemented the "Option A — IDE Control Surface Pack" to establish "tooling as contract".

## Changes Implemented

### Documentation & Policy
- **[IDE_COMPLIANCE.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/docs/IDE_COMPLIANCE.md)**: Created the compliance checklist for PRs.
- **[CI_PARITY.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/docs/CI_PARITY.md)**: Created the runbook for local CI reproduction.

### Dev Environment
- **[devcontainer.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)**: Configured the reference dev container with Python 3.11, VS Code settings, and extensions.

### Tooling
- **[.pre-commit-config.yaml](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/.pre-commit-config.yaml)**: Configured pre-commit hooks including Black, Ruff, and ADK schema validation.

### Surface Contract
- **[SurfaceContract.v0.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/SurfaceContract.v0.json)**: Created the binding file referencing all the above artifacts.

## Verification Results

### File Existence Check
I verified that all files were created at their respective paths:
- [docs/IDE_COMPLIANCE.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/docs/IDE_COMPLIANCE.md) (Checked)
- [docs/CI_PARITY.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/docs/CI_PARITY.md) (Checked)
- [.devcontainer/devcontainer.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) (Created)
- [.pre-commit-config.yaml](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/.pre-commit-config.yaml) (Created)
- [SurfaceContract.v0.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/SurfaceContract.v0.json) (Created)

### Validation
Each file contains the exact content specified in the requirements. The [SurfaceContract.v0.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/SurfaceContract.v0.json) correctly points to the `adk://` URIs defined in the file headers.
