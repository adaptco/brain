# Implementation Plan - .NET Environment Setup

The goal is to install the .NET SDK and guide the user to set up VS Code for .NET development.

## User Review Required
- [ ] **Approval to install software**: I will use `winget` to install the .NET 8 SDK. This requires administrative privileges or user approval in the terminal.

## Proposed Changes
### System Environment
- Install `Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8` via `winget`.

### Workspace
- Create a temporary `HelloDotNet` directory to verify installation.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `dotnet --version` to verify successful installation.
- Run `dotnet new console -n HelloDotNet` to create a test project.
- Run `dotnet run --project HelloDotNet` to verify it builds and runs.

### Manual Verification
- User should open VS Code and install the "C# Dev Kit" extension if not already present.
