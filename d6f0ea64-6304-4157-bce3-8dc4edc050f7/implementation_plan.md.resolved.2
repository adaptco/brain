## Proposed Changes

### Tests
- [MODIFY] [Makefile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/Makefile)
    - Add `test_engine` target to compile and run `tests/engine_test.cpp`.
    - Link against engine objects.
- [MODIFY] [tests/engine_test.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/tests/engine_test.cpp)
    - Ensure it compiles and passes.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `make test` which should now run both `safety_test` and `test_engine`.
