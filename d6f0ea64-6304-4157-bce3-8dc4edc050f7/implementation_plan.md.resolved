# Stripe CLI Installation and Setup

## Goal Description
Install the Stripe CLI to enable management of Stripe resources from the command line. This setup will use the existing Chocolatey installation on the Windows system.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> The installation involves running `choco install stripe-cli`. This might require administrative privileges depending on how Chocolatey is configured.
> After installation, you will need to complete the `stripe login` flow in your browser.

## Proposed Changes

### System
- Run `choco install stripe-cli` to install the tool.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Run `stripe --version` to confirm successful installation.

### Manual Verification
- User completes `stripe login`.
- User can run a test command like `stripe customers list`.
