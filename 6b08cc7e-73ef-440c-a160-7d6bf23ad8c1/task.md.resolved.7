# Verification Strategy Implementation

## Tasks

- [x] Create implementation plan for review
- [x] Fix [bundle_id](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/Downloads/Qube/docling-cluster/tests/test_replay.py#30-43) generation to be deterministic (content-hash based)
- [x] Create `tests/` directory structure
- [x] Implement Replay Test (submit same doc twice → identical bundle_id/hashes)
- [x] Implement Integration Test (end-to-end ingest → ledger entry)
- [x] Add pytest configuration to pyproject.toml
- [x] Verify tests pass

## Embed Worker Implementation

- [x] Implement [embed-worker/worker.py](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/Downloads/Qube/docling-cluster/services/embed-worker/worker.py) from user snippet
- [x] Verify imports and schema compliance
- [x] Test deterministic embedding generation

## Batch Processing Evolution
- [/] Refine [embed_batch](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/Downloads/Qube/docling-cluster/services/embed-worker/worker.py#86-178) implementation in [worker.py](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/Downloads/Qube/docling-cluster/services/embed-worker/worker.py)
- [ ] Restore local path support and deterministic seeding
- [ ] Implement `verify_batch_logic.py` to test throughput and determinism
- [ ] Update walkthrough with "Scribe" Batch Processing details
