# Walkthrough - Release Candidate Blueprint (RC0)

I have successfully generated the **Release Candidate Blueprint** for the ADK (Artifact Development Kit) based on the "Docker-first" spine.

## Generated Artifacts

### Repository Structure [adk/](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/adk)
The following structure has been created in your workspace:

```text
adk/
├── adk.ps1            # Windows PowerShell Host Wrapper
├── adk                # Linux/Mac Host Wrapper
├── contracts/v0/      # The Immutable Standard
│   ├── schemas/       # artifact, event, gate_result, state, tool_policy
│   ├── state_machine/ # states.yaml, transitions.yaml
│   ├── gates/         # catalog.yaml, severity.yaml
│   └── mappings/      # vocabulary_map.yaml
├── cli/               # Docker-first Reference Implementation

├── docs/              # Boundaries & Threat Model
├── tests/             # Contract & Integration Tests
└── .github/workflows/ # CI & Release automation
```

### Key Decisions Implemented
1.  **Spine**: Docker-first. Logic encapsulated in [cli/Dockerfile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/cli/Dockerfile).
2.  **Wrappers**: Added [adk.ps1](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/adk.ps1) and [adk](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/adk) to handle Docker build/run + volume mounting.
3.  **Contracts**: Implemented strict JSON schemas and YAML policies in `contracts/v0`.
4.  **Vocabulary**: Implemented the `vocabulary_map` to bridge Public terms (Event Log) to Internal terms (SSOT).
5.  **CI/CD**: Added GitHub Actions for automatic validation and releasing.

## Verification
I have verified that:
- [x] All 5 core schemas exist.
- [x] The State Machine transitions are defined.
- [x] The CLI wrapper scripts act as the entry point.
- [x] The CI workflows are configured to test the contracts.
- [x] Host wrappers ([adk.ps1](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/adk.ps1), [adk](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/adk)) are present in the root.

## Next Steps

To run the tools (Windows):
```powershell
cd adk
.\adk.ps1 validate contracts
```

To run the tools (Linux/Mac):
```bash
cd adk
./adk validate contracts
```
