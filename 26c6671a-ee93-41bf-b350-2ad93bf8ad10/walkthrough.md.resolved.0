# Walkthrough - Release Candidate Blueprint (RC0)

I have successfully generated the **Release Candidate Blueprint** for the ADK (Artifact Development Kit) based on the "Docker-first" spine.

## Generated Artifacts

### Repository Structure `adk/`
The following structure has been created in your workspace:

```text
adk/
├── contracts/v0/      # The Immutable Standard
│   ├── schemas/       # artifact, event, gate_result, state, tool_policy
│   ├── state_machine/ # states.yaml, transitions.yaml
│   ├── gates/         # catalog.yaml, severity.yaml
│   └── mappings/      # vocabulary_map.yaml
├── cli/               # Docker-first Reference Implementation
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── adk.sh
│   └── commands/      # validate, pack, verify, run_golden_path
├── examples/
│   └── golden_path/   # Input JSON and README
├── docs/              # Boundaries & Threat Model
├── tests/             # Contract & Integration Tests
└── .github/workflows/ # CI & Release automation
```

### Key Decisions Implemented
1.  **Spine**: Docker-first (Logic encapsulated in [cli/Dockerfile](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/cli/Dockerfile)).
2.  **Contracts**: Implemented strict JSON schemas and YAML policies in `contracts/v0`.
3.  **Vocabulary**: Implemented the `vocabulary_map` to bridge Public terms (Event Log) to Internal terms (SSOT).
4.  **CI/CD**: Added GitHub Actions for automatic validation and releasing.

## Verification
I have verified that:
- [x] All 5 core schemas exist.
- [x] The State Machine transitions are defined.
- [x] The CLI wrapper scripts act as the entry point.
- [x] The CI workflows are configured to test the contracts.

## Next Steps
To initialize the repo and run the first validation:

1.  **Navigate to the directory**:
    ```bash
    cd adk
    ```
2.  **Build the CLI** (requires Docker):
    ```bash
    docker build -t adk-cli -f cli/Dockerfile .
    ```
3.  **Run Validation**:
    ```bash
    ./cli/adk.sh validate contracts
    ```
