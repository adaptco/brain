# Implementation Plan - Vehicle Agent Avatar

## Goal Description
Create an IS-F model container, an "Alexis" driver, and a "Lexus" avatar agent to replace the simple player logic in the game application. The agent should model a "Super App Super Model" behavior.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> The driver logic in [AlexisDriver.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/AlexisDriver.js) is currently a placeholder ("running all the time"). We may need to expand this to be more "agentic" or complex based on further requirements.

## Proposed Changes

### Game Logic (`server/react-client/src/game`)
#### [NEW] [ISFModel.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/ISFModel.js)
- Implements vehicle physics (mass, acceleration, friction).
- Acts as the "Container" for the agent.

#### [NEW] [AlexisDriver.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/AlexisDriver.js)
- Implements the driver intelligence.
- Currently has simple "aggressive vs. cruising" states.

#### [NEW] [LexusAgent.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/LexusAgent.js)
- The Avatar class that combines the Body (ISFModel) and the Driver (Alexis).
- Provides a `getRenderState()` method for the UI.

### UI Components (`server/react-client/src/components`)
#### [MODIFY] [GameCanvas.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/components/GameCanvas.jsx)
- Replaced simple `player` ref with `LexusAgent` instance.
- Updated render loop to draw the agent and its status (Agent Name, Driver Name, State).

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `npm run build` (or equivalent) in `server/react-client` to ensure no syntax/import errors.

### Manual Verification
- Inspect the code to ensure imports match file paths.
