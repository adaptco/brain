# Walkthrough - Vehicle Agent Avatar

I have successfully implemented the "Lexus" Avatar Agent, which models a "Super App Super Model" behavior, driven by "Alexis" inside an "IS-F" container.

## Changes

### 1. New Agent Architecture
I created three new classes in `server/react-client/src/game`:

- **[ISFModel.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/ISFModel.js)**: A physics container representing the vehicle.
- **[AlexisDriver.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/AlexisDriver.js)**: The driver intelligence with states (IDLE, DRIVING, OPTIMIZING).
- **[LexusAgent.js](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/LexusAgent.js)**: The composite Agent.

### 2. UI Integration
I updated **[GameCanvas.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/components/GameCanvas.jsx)** to:
- Instantiated the `LexusAgent`.
- Run the agent's `update()` loop.
- Render the agent's position and internal state (Driver Name, State, etc.) on the canvas.

### 3. Documentation Fixes
I also resolved markdown lint errors in **[boundaries.md](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/adk/docs/boundaries.md)**.

## Verification Results

### Build Verification
I ran `npm run build` in `server/react-client`, and it completed successfully:
```

> vite build

This confirms that all imports are correct and the code syntax is valid.
