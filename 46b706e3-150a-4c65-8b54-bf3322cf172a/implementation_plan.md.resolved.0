# Implementation Plan - Wire Agentic Runtime to Geodesic Qube

The goal is to transition the current 2D Agent visualization to a 3D "Geodesic Qube" structure, powered by the existing [LexusAgent](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/LexusAgent.js#9-44) runtime model. This involves setting up a 3D environment using React Three Fiber and connecting the agent's state to the 3D geometry.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Visualization Interpretation**: "Qube" with "Geodesic Structure" is interpreted as a **Geodesic Sphere** (Icosahedron) or a structure representing the agent's core. We will use a high-detail Icosahedron to visualize the geodesic lattice.

> [!NOTE]
> **Dependency Addition**: We will add `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, and `@react-three/drei` to the project.

## Proposed Changes

### Server/React-Client

#### [NEW] [AgenticStructure.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/components/AgenticStructure.jsx)
- Creates a 3D wrapper for the Agentic Runtime.
- Instantiates [LexusAgent](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/game/LexusAgent.js#9-44).
- Uses `useFrame` (R3F loop) to drive `agent.update()`.
- Renders the "Geodesic Qube" which reacts to agent state (rotation, pulse, color).

#### [MODIFY] [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/App.jsx)
- Replaces or augments [GameCanvas](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/src/components/GameCanvas.jsx#4-112) with `AgenticStructure`.
- Passes WebSocket events (Genesis Protocol) to the new structure.

#### [MODIFY] [package.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/server/react-client/package.json)
- Add dependencies: `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Build verification: `npm run build`.

### Manual Verification
1. Start the client: `npm run dev`.
2. Verify a 3D Geodesic structure is visible.
3. Verify it animates (indicating the Agent runtime is ticking).
4. Trigger "Genesis Event" via WebSocket (using the server) and observe changes in the visualization.
