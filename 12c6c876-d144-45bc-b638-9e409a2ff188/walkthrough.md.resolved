# Big Boss Implementation & Game App Shell Walkthrough

I have implemented the "Big Boss" agent and the requested "Game App Shell" (Web Terminal).

## Changes

### 1. Game App Shell (Web Terminal) [NEW]

I added a retro-style terminal overlay to the React Client.

#### [Terminal.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/react-client/src/components/Terminal.jsx)
- **Features**:
  - Command input parsing (`/deploy`, `/clear`).
  - Scrolling log output.
  - Sends `/deploy` as a genesis trigger command to the engine.

#### [App.jsx](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/react-client/src/App.jsx)
- Integrated `<Terminal />` into the main layout.

#### [index.css](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/server/react-client/src/index.css)
- Added retro styling (Matrix/Terminal green on black, monospace fonts).

### 2. The Big Boss & Model Deployment

#### [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/BigBoss.hpp)
- **Rage Mode**: Moves faster (speed 2.0 vs 0.5) when `rageTimer_` exceeds 5 seconds.
- **Health**: Starts with 500 health.
- **Model Deployment**: [DeployEmergence](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp#31-39) method spawns the Genesis Plane.

#### [Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp)
- **Engine Wiring**: Delegates [TriggerGenesis](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#32-41) logic to the Boss.

## Verification

### Automated Tests
- Verification suite: [tests/boss_test.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/tests/boss_test.cpp).
  - Verifies Big Boss behavior and deployment logic.

### Manual Verification
1.  **Start the App**: `npm run dev` (client) & `npm run start` (server).
2.  **Open Browser**: Go to the client URL (usually http://localhost:5173).
3.  **Use the Shell**:
    - Type `/deploy` in the command prompt at the bottom.
    - **Observe**: The terminal logs "Genesis Plane" events, and the game world should update with the new plane.
