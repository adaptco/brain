# Create The Big Boss Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Create a formidable "Big Boss" character for the game engine. This involves refactoring the existing [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.cpp#6-7) class to support polymorphism and implementing a new `BigBoss` subclass with enhanced stats and behaviors (e.g., higher health, different movement pattern).

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This change involves modifying the existing [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.cpp#6-7) class to make [Update](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#24-41) virtual. This is a minor refactor but necessary for correct polymorphism.

## Proposed Changes

### Agents

#### [MODIFY] [Boss.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp)
- Make [Update](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#24-41) method `virtual`.
- Make destructor `virtual`.
- Change members to `protected` so `BigBoss` can access them (or add getters/setters).

#### [NEW] [BigBoss.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/BigBoss.hpp)
- Define `BigBoss` class inheriting from [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.cpp#6-7).
- Override [Update](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#24-41) method.
- Add specific members for Big Boss if needed (e.g., `rageMode`).

#### [NEW] [BigBoss.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp)
- Implement `BigBoss::Update`.
    - Behavior: Moves slower but has a "Jump" or "Charge" mechanic (simulated).
    - Health: Initialize with 500.

### Engine

#### [MODIFY] [Sandbox.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp)
- Include `BigBoss.hpp`.
- Instantiate `BigBoss` instead of [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.cpp#6-7) in [Initialize](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#10-16).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Create `tests/boss_test.cpp` to verify:
    - [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/Boss.cpp#6-7) and `BigBoss` instantiation.
    - Polymorphism (calling [Update](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#24-41) on base pointer).
    - Health values.

### Manual Verification
- Run the [Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#8-9) (if executable) or use `tests/boss_test.cpp` output to verify behavior logs (e.g., "Big Boss charges!").
