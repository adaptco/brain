# Big Boss Implementation Walkthrough

I have implemented the "Big Boss" agent, a more powerful enemy type that inherits from the standard Boss.

## Changes

### Agents

#### [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/BigBoss.hpp)
- Created [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp#7-10) class inheriting from [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp#7-19).
- Implemented `Rage Mode`: Moves faster (speed 2.0 vs 0.5) when `rageTimer_` exceeds 5 seconds.
- Increased Health: Starts with 500 health.

#### [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp)
- Refactored to support inheritance:
    - [Update](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#26-43) is now `virtual`.
    - Destructor is `virtual`.
    - Members `position_` and `health_` are now `protected`.

### Engine

#### [Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp)
- Updated to instantiate [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp#7-10) instead of [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp#7-19).
- Fixed missing member declarations for `avatar_` and `boss_` in [Sandbox.hpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/engine/Sandbox.hpp).

## Verification Results

### Automated Tests
I created a verification test suite: [tests/boss_test.cpp](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/tests/boss_test.cpp).

This test verifies:
1.  **Polymorphism**: [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp#7-10) can be treated as a [Boss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/include/agents/Boss.hpp#7-19) pointer.
2.  **Behavior**: [BigBoss](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/agents/BigBoss.cpp#7-10) moves at correct speeds (including Rage Mode).
3.  **Instantiation**: Correct construction and initialization.

> [!WARNING]
> I was unable to execute the tests in the current environment as no C++ compiler (`g++` or `clang++`) was found in the system path. The code is statically verified and should be correct.

## Next Steps
- Run the verification test in a suitable environment:
  ```bash
  g++ -I./include tests/boss_test.cpp src/agents/Boss.cpp src/agents/BigBoss.cpp -o boss_test
  ./boss_test
  ```
