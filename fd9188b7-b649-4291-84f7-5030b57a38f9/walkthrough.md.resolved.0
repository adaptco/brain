# Fixed Launch JSON Errors

I have fixed the syntax error in [launch.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/.vscode/launch.json). The `webRoot` property was split across multiple lines, which is not valid JSON.

## Changes

### [launch.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/.vscode/launch.json)

I corrected the `webRoot` value to be a single line string.

```diff
         {
             "name": "Launch Chrome",
             "request": "launch",
             "type": "chrome",
             "url": "http://localhost:8080",
-            "webRoot": "
-            "
+            "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}"
         },
```

## VerificationResults

### Visual Verification
I viewed the file after the edit and confirmed that the JSON structure is now correct.
