# Walkthrough: Workspace Fixes and C++ Include Resolution

I have resolved the persistent C++ include errors and markdown warnings in your workspace.

## C++ Include Path Resolution

The "file not found" errors were caused by IntelliSense being unable to probe the compiler for standard library paths in your environment. I fixed this by:
1. **Adding explicit absolute paths** to [c_cpp_properties.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json) for:
   - Project includes
   - MSVC Standard Library
   - Windows SDK (UCRT, Shared, UM)
2. **Implementing an explicit destructor** in the [Sandbox](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/playground/ghost-void/src/engine/Sandbox.cpp#9-10) class to resolve the "incomplete type" error (`C2027`) caused by `unique_ptr` and forward declarations.

### Manual Verification
I verified that the code now compiles using the actual compiler on your system:
```powershell
& "cl.exe" /I"./include" ... src/main.cpp
# Output: main.cpp (Success)
```

## Markdown Warning Fixes
- **GEMINI.md**: Added a top-level heading and adjusted spacing to satisfy markdown linting.
- **README.md**: Added a missing language specifier to a fenced code block.

## Deployment Status: Docling Cluster
The local deployment script `deploy-local.bat` for `docling-cluster` was executed but failed because **Docker Desktop is not running**. Once you start Docker, let me know and I can retry the deployment.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Reload VS Code Window** (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window") to refresh IntelliSense.
2. **Start Docker Desktop** if you wish to proceed with the `docling-cluster` deployment.
