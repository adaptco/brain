# Tsukuba Trial Walkthrough

We have successfully implemented and executed the "Tsukuba Trial" Embedding Circuit routine.

## Implementation Details

### Circuit Architecture
The [EmbeddingCircuit](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/training/circuit.py) compresses vehicle telemetry into a 64-dimensional "Driver Signature" before decoding it into control actions (Steer, Throttle, Brake).

### Rewards
The [reward system](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/training/reward.py) encourages:
- **Pace**: Reward for speed.
- **Smoothness**: Penalty for jerky steering.
- **Stability**: Severe penalty for high slip angles.

### Training
The [training script](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/training/train.py) initializes the circuit, runs a mock simulation of the Tsukuba circuit, and optimizes the policy.

## Verification Results

### Artifact Minted
The training routine ran successfully and produced the circuit artifact:
- [suzuki_r32_circuit.pt](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/knowledge/training/suzuki_r32_circuit.pt)
