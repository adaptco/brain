# CI Enforcement Contract Generation Plan

## Goal Description
Generate the `suzuki_v1.contract.json` file to define the hard mathematical invariants for `TokenSuzuki.PocketBunny.R32` as a "Governed Artifact". This contract will serve as the "Topological Fence" for CI/CD enforcement, ensuring the "PETRIFIED" status of the release candidate.

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This action will create a new directory structure `adk-contracts/governance/` if it does not exist, to strictly follow the requested path `adk-contracts/governance/suzuki_v1.contract.json`.

## Proposed Changes
### ADK Contracts
#### [NEW] [suzuki_v1.contract.json](file:///c:/Users/eqhsp/.gemini/antigravity/implicit/adk-contracts/governance/suzuki_v1.contract.json)
- Create file with the following defined components and invariants:
    - **Identity Core**: `TokenSuzuki.PocketBunny.R32` (MINTED)
    - **Geometry Plane**: Mass, Inertia, & PBR Zones (CALCIFIED)
    - **Control Plane**: State-Action-State Lattice (BOUND)
    - **Audit Plane**: 1,000,000 Step HIRR Gate (ENFORCED)
    - **Invariants**:
        - LapTime variance < 0.001s
        - Hash Drift = 0

## Verification Plan
### Manual Verification
- Verify the file exists at `adk-contracts/governance/suzuki_v1.contract.json`.
- inspect the content to ensure all invariants and component statuses are correctly defined as JSON.
