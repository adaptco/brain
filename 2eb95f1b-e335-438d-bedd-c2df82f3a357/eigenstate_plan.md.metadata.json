  "summary": "Detailed implementation plan for a self-referential AI system that creates a 4-cycle eigenstate loop (pixel → token → checkpoint → pixel) with auto-coding, auto-execution, and unit testing. The system maintains stateless operation by capturing and reconstructing the full eigenstate in each cycle, proving perfect information preservation through deterministic hashing.",
