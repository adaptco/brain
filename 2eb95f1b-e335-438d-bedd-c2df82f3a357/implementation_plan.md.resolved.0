# Join Dots Game - Implementation Plan

A visually stunning Connect Four game with AI integration powered by window.ai.complete, featuring smooth animations, glassmorphism design, and three difficulty levels.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This implementation uses **window.ai.complete** for AI opponent logic. This API requires Chrome with built-in AI capabilities or a compatible browser extension. The game will gracefully handle cases where the API is unavailable.

> [!NOTE]
> The game will be built as a single-page React application using Vite for fast development and Tailwind CSS for styling. All game logic runs client-side with no backend required.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Manual Verification

1. **Difficulty Selection**: Verify all three difficulty buttons work and start the game
2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Test piece dropping in all columns
   - Verify pieces stack correctly
   - Test all win conditions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
   - Verify draw detection when board is full
3. **AI Behavior**:
   - **Easy**: Confirm AI makes casual moves, doesn't always block
   - **Medium**: Verify AI plays well but makes occasional mistakes
   - **Hard**: Confirm AI always blocks wins and plays strategically
4. **Animations**:
   - Verify smooth piece drop animations
   - Check last move ring highlight appears
   - Confirm winning pieces pulse
   - Test hover effects on columns
5. **Visual Design**:
   - Verify animated background with floating orbs
   - Check glassmorphism effects on panels
   - Confirm gradient colors and glow effects
   - Test responsive layout
6. **AI Thinking Panel**:
   - Verify AI's thinking process displays
   - Check move history tracking
   - Confirm loading state during AI computation

### Browser Compatibility

Test in Chrome with window.ai support or verify graceful fallback behavior.
