# Walkthrough - Resolving SSH Config Error

The user reported an error where the `antigravity-remote-openssh` extension failed because it couldn't find [C:\Users\eqhsp\.ssh\config](file:///Users/eqhsp/.ssh/config).

## Changes Made
- Created the directory `C:\Users\eqhsp\.ssh`.
- Created an empty file `C:\Users\eqhsp\.ssh\config`.

## Verification Results
- Ran `Test-Path 'C:\Users\eqhsp\.ssh\config'` which returned `True`.
